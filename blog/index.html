<p>In this presentation I am talking about the Evaluation Reporting which is a very important step in the process for gaining information on prototypes from outside sources.  At the beginning I basically just state all the important headers that appeared in the chapter and go into further detail with each slide that comes afterword.  The next slide is a diagram of the process which we are already used to from previous presentations in the class.  The process stage that comes before the Evaluation Reporting is the Prototype stage and the further you go back you find yourself looping to the Evaluation stage once again because it is a confined cycle.</p>
	<p>The Quality Communication and Reporting portion in the Evaluation Reporting process talks about the importance of having a fast response to any feedback that is received.  Although if you want to achieve something of value in return, there needs to be information from the team and persuasion to have them invest more into what you are doing.  Additionally, the idea of participants should stay in anonymity and protect the individual that is testing your work.</p>
	<p>Next, reporting informal summative results and qualitative formative results I put together in one single slide.  One side that is important is to keep the participant informed with you project so that nothing is misrepresented in a way that you would not approve.  The presentation and format of the content depend greatly on the context and techniques which are used in both of these steps.</p>
	<p>Furthermore, the formative reporting content stage includes a general list of examples that are important to keep in mind.  There is the problem description, the best judgments of the problem causes, an estimate of its severity, and finally the suggested solutions.  For all of the information, justifying the fixes make a compelling impact on the users.</p>
	<p>Finally, there is the formative reporting audience, needs, goals and context of use.  They include in particular the engender awareness which makes the results unbiased, the teaching concepts for educating the user as they play around with it, the sell buy-in to keep them as engaged as possible, and the present rules where they can hear the latest material about your progress.</p>

<p>I decided to approach this project with a side of music as the theme.  It started off very simple, but as I got more into the library that I chose, some of the more difficult parts began to appear.  I started off by making a cutout of all the keys to one octave of a piano, and then wanted to set them up in the layout of the screen.  The library allows you to use sound clips and play them when the mouse is clicked on a certain area.  More specifically it works on a button that is made separately from the images.  I learned how to import sound clips and make them useful, but I'm still trying to understand how I can match them with an image instead of a button.  I would rate it as pretty simple and straight forward, I was just stumped on some of the javascript to make it work for my specific needs.</p>

<p>I decided to connect the mouseover and mouseout functions in the JQuery to react to the mouse's location on the screen.  The moment that you scroll over one of the thumbnail sketches the large photo in the middle will become visible to the eye.  Using the sketches as thumbnails was one of the first solutions to the task of the supportive interface design because there was a reasonable connection to the photos themselves.  The click command was also used to make a description appear in the top right boxes location on the screen.  This way you could read what I was relating my images to with everyday items that I bring around.  Finally, I built in the fade animation that would make smooth transitions for the photos and the thumbnails becoming visible.  These were all connected and made visible changes once they were acted on.</p>

<p>I think this is an engaging design for this website, because it allows for multiple effects to take place depending on where you place the mouse.  It color codes the groupings and divides them up into manageable portions that one can appreciate.  Furthermore, there is a lot of subtle information that is shared when you scroll over the categories at the top left part of the screen.  A person can have fun figuring out what I am doing and where I am at with pretty  exact methods.</p>

<p>The webpage that I used for this particular blog post was SoundCloud, because I find myself on this site all the time looking for music to listen to.  There is a hierarchy through the buttons that are available and the drop down list that lets you look through the different genres of music with ease.  The "Home" and "Collection" at the top are used the most along with the "Profile" feature at the top right of the screen.  They allow you to navigate through the majority of the website without needing to even type anything and that allows for a much faster experience.   The nice thing about this site compared to Pandora for example, is that we are free to make our own playlists and at the same time it will play new music after your original playlist finishes.</p>

<p>I tend to use my laptop interface for a lot of my researching needs.  I have been known to make use of the windows platform because it is efficient and highly accurate.  Furthermore, I have found that the software downloaded throughout the machine is helpful and versatile.  I think that the internet browsing programs available to all the users is incredibly useful as well, because it allows for a different approach at the same websites to fit the needs of the user.  Other features like Skype and instant messaging are helping to improve the networking capabilities that are known for greater communication.  The interesting thing about the laptop computer is that there tends to be an easy and portable  method for changing locations and still having the ability to make use of other wifi networks.  The only major downside to this machine is the battery life which seems to lessen after every charge.</p>
