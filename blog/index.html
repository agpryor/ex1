Blog #4</h3>

<p>I decided to connect the mouseover and mouseout functions in the JQuery to react to the mouse's location on the screen.  The moment that you scroll over one of the thumbnail sketches the large photo in the middle will become visible to the eye.  Using the sketches as thumbnails was one of the first solutions to the task of the supportive interface design because there was a reasonable connection to the photos themselves.  The click command was also used to make a description appear in the top right boxes location on the screen.  This way you could read what I was relating my images to with everyday items that I bring around.  Finally, I built in the fade animation that would make smooth transitions for the photos and the thumbnails becoming visible.  These were all connected and made visible changes once they were acted on.</p>

<p>I think this is an engaging design for this website, because it allows for multiple effects to take place depending on where you place the mouse.  It color codes the groupings and divides them up into manageable portions that one can appreciate.  Furthermore, there is a lot of subtle information that is shared when you scroll over the categories at the top left part of the screen.  A person can have fun figuring out what I am doing and where I am at with pretty  exact methods.</p>

Blog #2</h3>

<p>The webpage that I used for this particular blog post was SoundCloud, because I find myself on this site all the time looking for music to listen to.  There is a hierarchy through the buttons that are available and the drop down list that lets you look through the different genres of music with ease.  The "Home" and "Collection" at the top are used the most along with the "Profile" feature at the top right of the screen.  They allow you to navigate through the majority of the website without needing to even type anything and that allows for a much faster experience.   The nice thing about this site compared to Pandora for example, is that we are free to make our own playlists and at the same time it will play new music after your original playlist finishes.</p>

Blog #1</h3>

<p>I tend to use my laptop interface for a lot of my researching needs.  I have been known to make use of the windows platform because it is efficient and highly accurate.  Furthermore, I have found that the software downloaded throughout the machine is helpful and versatile.  I think that the internet browsing programs available to all the users is incredibly useful as well, because it allows for a different approach at the same websites to fit the needs of the user.  Other features like Skype and instant messaging are helping to improve the networking capabilities that are known for greater communication.  The interesting thing about the laptop computer is that there tends to be an easy and portable  method for changing locations and still having the ability to make use of other wifi networks.  The only major downside to this machine is the battery life which seems to lessen after every charge.</p>
